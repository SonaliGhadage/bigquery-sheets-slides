Apps Script Intro codelab
=========================

This codelab introduces developers to Google Apps Script, our customized JavaScript-in-the-cloud application hosting platform which gives developers integrated access to G Suite, Google, and external services. Access it at http://g.co/codelabs/apps-script-intro.

Introduction
------------

In this codelab, we'll introduce you to one of the easiest ways to write code that accesses Google developer technologies, all by leveraging one of the mainstream web development languages, JavaScript. Using Google Apps Script, you will write code to extract an address sitting in a cell in a Google Sheet, generate a Google Map based on that address, and send a link of the map to yourself or a friend using Gmail. The best part? It'll really only be 4 lines of code!
